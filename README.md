# Java-Oops

In Java - which ever class/object you create it's parent will be Object(super parent) class

Main class contains :

1. Polimorphisum
2. constrcutor
3. overload constrcutor/using this() keyword
   Using this() keyword - you can call other constrcutor of your class, also userd to define values to the variable of same class, like this.age = age
4. static variable in class - property of class, does not depend on object
5. Interietnce
   Super key word: Use to call constrcutor of parent
   run time polimorphisum - again declaring a mothod with new defination, which is alredy available in parent class
6. Encapsulation
   Packages and access modifiers
